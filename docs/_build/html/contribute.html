<p>You are here to help on Read the Docs? Awesome, feel welcome and read the
following sections in order to know what and how to work on something. If you
get stuck at any point you can create a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues">ticket on GitHub</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="contributing-to-development">
<h2>Contributing to development<a class="headerlink" href="#contributing-to-development" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you want to deep dive and help out with development on Read the Docs, then
first get the project installed locally according to the
<a class="reference internal" href="install.html#installing-read-the-docs"><span>Installation Guide</span></a>. After that is done we
suggest you have a look at tickets in our issue tracker that are labelled <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+First+Bug%22">Good
First Bug</a>. These are meant to be a great way to get a smooth start and
won&#8217;t put you in front of the most complex parts of the system.</p>
<p>If you are up to more challenging tasks with a bigger scope, then there are a
set of tickets with a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues?direction=desc&amp;labels=Feature+Overview&amp;page=1&amp;sort=updated&amp;state=open">Feature Overview</a> tag. These tickets have a general
overview and description of the work required to finish. If you want to start
somewhere, this would be a good place to start. That said, these aren&#8217;t
necessarily the easiest tickets. They are simply things that are explained. If
you still didn&#8217;t find something to work on, search for the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ASprintable">Sprintable</a>
label. Those tickets are meant to be standalone and can be worked on ad-hoc.</p>
<p>When contributing code, then please follow the standard Contribution
Guidelines set forth at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.contribution-guide.org/#submitting-bugs">contribution-guide.org</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="triaging-tickets">
<h2>Triaging tickets<a class="headerlink" href="#triaging-tickets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here is a brief explanation on how we triage incoming tickets to get a better
sense of what needs to be done on what end.</p>
<div class="section" id="initial-triage">
<h3>Initial triage<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-triage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When sitting down to do some triaging work, we start with the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+no:label">list of
untriaged tickets</a>. We consider all tickets that do not have a label as
untriaged. The first step is to categorize the ticket into one of the
following categories and either close the ticket or assign an appropriate
label. The reported issue …</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>… is not valid</dt>
<dd><p class="first">If you think the ticket is invalid comment why you think it is invalid,
then close the ticket. Tickets might be invalid if they were already fixed
in the past or it was decided that the proposed feature will not be
implemented because it does not conform with the overall goal of Read the
Docs. Also if you happen to know that the problem was already reported,
label the ticket with <strong>Status: duplicate</strong>, reference the other ticket
that is already addressing the problem and close the duplicate.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li><em>Builds fail when using matplotlib</em>:
If the described issue was already fixed, then explain and instruct to
re-trigger the build.</li>
<li><em>Provide way to upload arbitrary HTML files</em>:
It was already decided that Read the Docs is not a dull hosting platform
for HTML. So explain this and close the ticket.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="triage-not-enough-information">
<dt>… does not provide enough information</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Add the label <strong>Needed: more information</strong> if the reported issue does not
contain enough information to decide if it is valid or not and ask on the
ticket for the required information to go forward. We will re-triage all
tickets that have the label <strong>Needed: more information</strong> assigned. If the
original reporter left new information we can try to re-categorize the
ticket. If the reporter did not come back to provide more required
information after a long enough time, we will close the ticket (this will be
roughly about two weeks).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li><em>My builds stopped working. Please help!</em>
Ask for a link to the build log and for which project is affected.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>… is a valid enhancement proposal</dt>
<dd><p class="first">If the ticket contains an enhancement proposal that aligns with the goals
of Read the Docs, then add the label <strong>Enhancement</strong>. If the proposal
seems valid but requires further discussion between core contributors
because there might be different possibilities on how to implement the
enhancement, then also add the label <strong>Needed: design decision</strong>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li><em>Improve documentation about MKdocs integration</em></li>
<li><em>Provide better integration with service XYZ</em></li>
<li><em>Refactor module X for better readability</em></li>
<li><em>Achieve world domination</em> (also needs the label <strong>Needed: design
decision</strong>)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>… is a valid problem within the code base:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">If it&#8217;s a valid bug, then add the label <strong>Bug</strong>. Try to reference related
issues if you come across any.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li><em>Builds fail if conf.py contains non-ascii letters</em></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>… is a currently valid problem with the infrastructure:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Users might report about web server downtimes or that builds are not
triggered. If the ticket needs investigation on the servers, then add the
label <strong>Operations</strong>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li><em>Builds are not starting</em></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="triage-support-tickets">
<dt>… is a question and needs answering:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">If the ticket contains a question about the Read the Docs platform or the
code, then add the label <strong>Support</strong>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li><em>My account was set inactive. Why?</em></li>
<li><em>How to use C modules with Sphinx autodoc?</em></li>
<li><em>Why are my builds failing?</em></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>… requires a one-time action on the server:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Tasks that require a one time action on the server should be assigned the
two labels <strong>Support</strong> and <strong>Operations</strong>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li><em>Please change my username</em></li>
<li><em>Please set me as owner of this abandoned project</em></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>After we finished the initial triaging of new tickets, no ticket should be left
without a label.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="additional-labels-for-categorization">
<h3>Additional labels for categorization<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-labels-for-categorization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Additionally to the labels already involved in the section above, we have a
few more at hand to further categorize issues.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>High Priority</em></dt>
<dd>If the issue is urgent, assign this label. In the best case also go forward to
resolve the ticket yourself as soon as possible.</dd>
<dt><em>Community Effort</em></dt>
<dd>There are many valuable ideas in the issue tracker for future enhancements
of Read the Docs. Unfortunately too many for the core developers to handle
all of them. Therefore we assign the <em>Community Effort</em> label on all the
issues that we see as valid for the project but that we currently do not
have the resources to work on. We encourage community members to work
on these tickets and to submit a pull request.</dd>
<dt><em>Good First Bug</em></dt>
<dd>This label marks tickets that are easy to get started with. The ticket
should be ideal for beginners to dive into the code base. Better is if the
fix for the issue only involves touching one part of the code.</dd>
<dt><em>Sprintable</em></dt>
<dd>Sprintable are all tickets that have the right amount of scope to be
handled during a sprint. They are very focused and encapsulated.</dd>
<dt><em>Feature Overview</em></dt>
<dd>If a feature is too big to be tackled in one ticket and should be split
up, then we have a feature overview ticket explaining the overarching
idea. Those tickets related to one feature should also be grouped by a
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/milestones">milestone</a>.</dd>

Come back to these tickets once in a while and close those that did not get
any new information from the reporter. If new information is available, go
and re-triage the ticket.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues?q=is:open+is:issue+label:Operations">Tickets labelled with Operations</a>:
